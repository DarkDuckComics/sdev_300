    <h1>About Dark Duck Comics</h1>
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
     <p>Dark Duck Comics started as a pre-deployment hobby, I grabbed a few books from a comic book store for if there would be downtime.</p>
    <p>We started this business because that few comics to pass the time turned into boxes when I got back home. My reading turned into hunting </p>
    <h3>Family Involvement</h3>
    <p>Our family plays a crucial role in the business by attending Comic Cons together, organizing boxes, and selling nationwide.</p>
    <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
    <p>Our mission is to enjoy the world of comics and pass down that enjoyment to future generations</p>
